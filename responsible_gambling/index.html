          <h4>Tips for Responsible Gambling</h4>
          <h5>Set a Budget:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Decide how much money you can afford to lose before you start
              gambling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never chase your losses by betting more than you can afford.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Set Time Limits:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Determine how much time you can spend on gambling and stick to
              it.
            </li>
            <li>Take regular breaks to avoid continuous gambling.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Avoid Gambling When Emotional:</h5>
          <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Make decisions with a clear mind.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Treat gambling as a form of entertainment, not a way to make
              money.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engage in other activities and hobbies to maintain a balanced
              lifestyle.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              Understand the rules, odds, and payout structures of the games
              you play.
            </li>
            <li>Knowledge can help you make informed decisions.</li>
